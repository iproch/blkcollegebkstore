I came up with this idea while looking for vintage black college tees to purchase, and I could barely find any. Most of the college apparel you buy comes from the bookstore when you're in school. These are very generic and plain, so I wanted to create a fresh look on that and put out quality fashionable garments that you can be proud to wear anywhere and support black colleges! I am hopeful that creating this space will bring more attention to the HBCUs and possibly push more of our black youth in that direction.<\/p><p><\/p><p>A portion of our profits is donated to the United Negro College Fund to help build a better generation for the future.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Motto: \"If you want to go quickly, go alone.
